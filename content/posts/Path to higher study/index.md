### My experience
I have started my journey from the ending of september 2021,  attended IELTS on October. Then I worked on my SOP and LORs. Took help from seniors, friends and my teachers. Then shortlisted universities to apply according to my profile. Basically, I applied for central admission to avoid interviews. I didn't know central admission also required interview sometimes. ü§ê <br>
Then again I mailed some faculties of different universities as suggested by my well wishers. Some of them replied and some of them didn't.

- Publications: 3 (Conference 2 as first author, 1 as second author)
Citations: 26 
- Work Experience: 1 month in a software company,  3 month as a full time lecturer at Daffodil International university, 3 years as a Full-Time Lecturer at Brac university.

### After obtaining Visa Date
After getting a suitable Visa interview date, next step is to start shopping beside preparing for Visa Interview and searching for apartment.
For apartment searching, if you don't know anyone who can manage an apartment for you, search in apartment.com app. The app version may not be available in Bangladesh, but the web version is accessible. Also there are some facebook groups for university students. search for that and then take decisions.

Buy refundable air tickets if your visa date is near your arriving date in usa. The earlier you buy a ticket, the less price you will get. Don't forget to take qatar student facilities while buying tickets.
We had only 2.30hour transition time in between two flights and I missed the next one for finding out luggages lately. So try to take more transition time . at least 4 hours to avoid these hassles. In airport you may need 5 to 6$ to carry bags , so make sure you bring change like
5$, 1$, 10$ with you.

Try to connect with the people as much as possible to get proper information of housing and everything. There should be facebook groups for bangladesh community of every university. 

In USA, the medical cost of eyes and dentals are not covered in normal insurance. So the pricing is insanely high. Make sure you see dentists and eye specialists in BD before leaving.

### Shopping List
You will find everything in USA, but initially it hurts to spend so much money to buy things. People try to bring everything but the weight limit gets existed in the blink of an eye. :'( so you can't.....

Here is the shopping list that people must buy before coming here.
The shopping list depends on state weather. Also if you are going to live alone, you must bring some basic things as you can't lend anything from roommates.

#### Bags
1. 2 28inch luggage which can cover 23 kgs. try to buy good brand. 1 bag (hard shell) costed around 10k another one (softshell) 7k.
2. 1 carry on bag of 20inch (it is not needed but recommended to take as it is easy to carry 7kg), It will cost around 6k.
3. you can take another backpack for carrying laptops and other devices. they never weight the backpack.
4. NEck pellow and sleeping mask. (as it will be a long journey, you can bring these for comfort)
5. keep moisturizer in your handbag as it is colder in plane

#### Outfits
1. Bring a lot of outfits with soft color and simple designs. here cloths are very costly compared to our country and quality is not that different. Normally people wear very basic colors. In fall, they love floral designs. 
2. Tshirts (As many as possible). you can buy it from any branded shop. but for women oposite of Dhaka college can be a perfect place to do a lot of shopping with minimum cost)
3. Several traditional outfits if you love to wear these.People enjoy fall color here. So bring cute yellow dresses. For snowfall , bring blue or red saree/dress. 
4. 6 to 7 trousers as it is comfortable and you can wear it anywhere.
5. 9 to 10 undergarments as you will never find these here with 100 to 200 taka.
6. minimum 1 JAcket and 4 Sweaters if you are going to colder states. You will buy it here as well. but deshi clothes are really good.
7. 10 to 12 half and full pants including jeans or any other materials and styles
8. One shoe is enough to bring as in USA you will get better options. Try to bring 1 hill/sandle to wear with traditional dresses.
9. bring a good Umbrella for initial days. you can bring raincoat if you are confortable.
10. Iron is not really needed to bring, if you have space , you can bring it.


#### Electronics:
1. You must buy an USA adapter if you are bringing your laptop and other deshi devices that doesn't support US plugs. it looks like this:

You can buy the converted in multiplan shop. the price is reasonable there. arounf 200 taka may be. in Bcity they ask an insane price.
2. One multiplug 
3. Power banks are costly in USA.

I am using one plus 8t and it is working fine.
6. don't bring rice cooker or anything like these , you can buy these from here.
7. Some Plastic bags and tissue should be taken for surviving iitiallly 

#### Food:
1. Bring dry food like instant noodles, chocolates and cookies to survive initial days if you can't cook.
2. Deshi moshla can be found here, for the initial days bring some. It is reccommended if you buy 200g bottles instead of packets. 
As buying containers with 1$ = 100taka still looks a lot at the starting.
3. garam mashla price is higher here. try to bring more if you love it. In walmart you will even find biriyani moshla as well.
4. seeds are not allowed to bring but sometimes they allow it in check in luggages. bring all the food items in check in to be safe.

6. Bring one plate, bowl and a water bottle. 
7. Crookeries can be found here in walmart so don't bring them.
8. Try to eat your favourite foods as much as possible before leaving, you will miss that the most.

#### Styling:
Check shein app or amazon app to see what people normally wear here and what is the cost.If you have space, you should bring these.
Don't buy anything new. whatever you have and want to bring, just take it. you will get these here as well.
1. Some traditional and  daily wearable jewellery
2. watch
3. sunglasses
4. hat
5. vanity bag (not more than 2)
6. you can bring your favourite make up items if you can't leave them. but it is not needed as you will get original make up things here

In USA, almost everything is cashless. You can't use uber without card. You can bring liquid cash for safety . 
When you will create a bank account here, you can simply deposit the cash there. For 2022, I brought almost 4.5k dollars and I have used overall 2k dollars at the starting to pay housing costs and other shopping before getting the salary.

You must have a credit card or duel currency card if you are coming alone and nobody is there to help. 
After arriving USA, buy a sim card (recommended mint or h20 for reasonable cost) to get access of internet. After you get a sim card, almost everything gets easier. 


### Few words

Sometimes people will discourage you saying it won't be possible to get admission in the first try. The thing is never loose hope. You try your level best.  The rest of the things will be your luck. The journey is never smooth. I got a visa interview date after trying day and night for almost 2 months. Before that, getting admission was matter of eligibility,  capability  but in case of visa date, it was all about luck which was the most stressful one so far. 

By the way, <b>don't forget to contact the coordinators to waive your application fee</b>.

However, the next top USA group is a treasure for every applicant. I am thankful to this group and every single person who supported me throughout this journey.

Best of luck to all the applicants. I pray and hope that the best things happen to each and every one of you.
