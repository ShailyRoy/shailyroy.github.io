### Step by Step
Exploring the world beyond academics! I'm certainly not an expert, and there are many individuals out there achieving much more in diverse fields! Many are thriving in amazing places! It's quite impressive! However, I'm content with my average achievements. :p Still, some have inquired, so I thought of penning down a post! If it helps anyone, that's great!

Essentially, venturing beyond academics doesn't necessarily mean pursuing a new job or a career goal! It might be a path where the destination is unclear, and perhaps, no one really knows where it leads! In my opinion, it's a journey where assistance is needed at every stage! There's a lot of uncertainty, so mental stability is crucial!

### GRE/IELTS
I have started my journey from the ending of september 2021. I haven't taken the GRE, so I can't provide insights on that. Many universities in the USA have waived the GRE requirement due to the pandemic, and some have made it optional. If you can take the GRE, it's definitely a plus. However, a strong profile without GRE is also worth considering! Information related to GRE waivers can be found by searching in higher studies fb groups. As for IELTS, watching English movies extensively is beneficial. Practice from the website IELTS online tests and follow tutorials from Liz, youtubers. Personal efforts are essential, and online resources are abundant. I started my preparation in September, took the test in October. I was a full time lecturer , so managing time was challenging, practiced IELTS things outside of office hours, got a good amount of support from the family. I'm not an avid English movie watcher, so I had to put in extra effort! What I gained from the process makes me happy!

### SOP/LOR 
For writing the SOP, it's crucial to read many SOPs. Afterward, craft your own! Some prefer having others read it after the initial draft. In my case, after reading, rewriting felt better! Searching for sample SOPs in groups like "Next Top USA" yields plenty of resources. SOPs should be updated according to each university's requirements, try to relate your research with the university faculties which helps for better chance. Regarding LOR, it's advisable to draft one yourself, and faculty members can make changes according to their perspective. You are the one who knows the best about your profile. Try to ssupport your statements with proof in the LOR. Writing three/four different formats for three LORs is good practice. It helps if faculty members can recognize you, so recommendation requests should be made wisely. Having at least seven recommenders is a good strategy for multiple universities. Reminders from your side are essential, as faculty members are often busy. When communicating with recommenders, maintain a formal and respectful tone to convey professionalism and gratitude. To streamline the recommendation process, consider completing all your university applications before reaching out. Seek explicit permission from recommenders before including their names, ensuring they are aware of the commitment. 

### CV/Resume/Website
It's essential to create a CV/Resume in LaTeX. A personal website on GitHub is also helpful, and using Google Analytics to track visits enhances your profile. When people from outside the country visit your website, it leaves a positive impression. The website acts as your portfolio! Emphasize your strong points in the CV, and detailed information about high school and secondary school isn't necessary. Minimal personal information, such as phone number and email address, is sufficient. Avoid unnecessary details like parents' names and birth dates. In the context of outside work or technology-related activities, having a publication is good, but if you don't have one, preprints using EasyChair for project papers are an option. Some universities are very interested in diversity, so mentioning extracurricular activities, especially for women in technology, is important. Contests, Olympiads, and similar achievements should be highlighted. Any work or gap years should be briefly mentioned. Not having any study gaps is also a plus!

### University Selection
I have primarily relied on online websites to find universities that match my profile. I have applied to universities where people I know are studying. I love to be with people and I am an ambivert person , So tried to be in the safe side. It is always helpful to have some known people around you in abroad. But if you can't make it, don't worry. I also came in a complete new place where I knew none. Initially I struggled, tried to connect with new people via social media even before coming to make things comfortable for me , networking is really important to survive here and finally got a circle to hangout later. I have also applied to places where my relatives and friends are applying. I admit I have been somewhat casual about the process and haven't conducted intense research. I have often sought help from my friends and seniors when needed.

The application fee is really high when you apply to multiple universities. Be prepared for that. Sometimes I requested a fee waiver due to financial constraints from the co-ordinators and they approved. The application process has taken time, and I had to be very patient. The deadlines for most universities were around December 15th, but some accepted applications until March.

After submitting applications, I waited, and in late January, I started receiving emails for interviews. I emphasized the importance of researching professors and being well-prepared for interviews. Weather considerations for the location of the university were also important. If the interview went well, there was hope for a positive outcome. 

Before applying, it was crucial to write a well-crafted email to professors expressing interest in joining their research. Although not all universities required it, many interviews were necessary. I personally received offers from two universities after interviews. Others were central.

Additionally, getting funding directly from professors could increase the chances of acceptance. But don't rely on the verbal promise. Celebrations followed when receiving I-20 offer letters, but the visa process was challenging.

Rejection chances were high (80%) once the universities started releasing results. Mental preparation was crucial to deal with potential disappointments. When multiple offers came in, selecting a university based on personal preference completed the process.

### After obtaining Visa Date
After getting a suitable Visa interview date, next step is to start shopping beside preparing for Visa Interview and searching for apartment.
For apartment searching, if you don't know anyone who can manage an apartment for you, search in apartment.com app. The app version may not be available in Bangladesh, but the web version is accessible. Also there are some facebook groups for university students. search for that and then take decisions.

Buy refundable air tickets if your visa date is near your arriving date in usa. The earlier you buy a ticket, the less price you will get. Don't forget to take qatar student facilities while buying tickets.
We had only 2.30hour transition time in between two flights and I missed the next one for finding out luggages lately. So try to take more transition time . at least 4 hours to avoid these hassles. In airport you may need 5 to 6$ to carry bags , so make sure you bring change like
5$, 1$, 10$ with you.

Try to connect with the people as much as possible to get proper information of housing and everything. There should be facebook groups for bangladesh community of every university. 

In USA, the medical cost of eyes and dentals are not covered in normal insurance. So the pricing is insanely high. Make sure you see dentists and eye specialists in BD before leaving.

### Shopping List
You will find everything in USA, but initially it hurts to spend so much money to buy things. People try to bring everything but the weight limit gets existed in the blink of an eye. :'( so you can't.....

Here is the shopping list that people must buy before coming here.
The shopping list depends on state weather. Also if you are going to live alone, you must bring some basic things as you can't lend anything from roommates.

#### Bags
1. 2 28inch luggage which can cover 23 kgs. try to buy good brand. 1 bag (hard shell) costed around 10k another one (softshell) 7k.
2. 1 carry on bag of 20inch (it is not needed but recommended to take as it is easy to carry 7kg), It will cost around 6k.
3. you can take another backpack for carrying laptops and other devices. they never weight the backpack.

In USA, almost everything is cashless. You can't use uber without card. You can bring liquid cash for safety . 
When you will create a bank account here, you can simply deposit the cash there. For 2022, I brought almost 4.5k dollars and I have used overall 2k dollars at the starting to pay housing costs and other shopping before getting the salary.

You must have a credit card or duel currency card if you are coming alone and nobody is there to help. 
After arriving USA, buy a sim card (recommended mint or h20 for reasonable cost) to get access of internet. After you get a sim card, almost everything gets easier. 


### Few words

Sometimes people will discourage you saying it won't be possible to get admission in the first try. The thing is never loose hope. You try your level best.  The rest of the things will be your luck. The journey is never smooth. I got a visa interview date after trying day and night for almost 2 months. Before that, getting admission was matter of eligibility,  capability  but in case of visa date, it was all about luck which was the most stressful one so far. 

By the way, <b>don't forget to contact the coordinators to waive your application fee</b>.

However, the next top USA group is a treasure for every applicant. I am thankful to this group and every single person who supported me throughout this journey.

Best of luck to all the applicants. I pray and hope that the best things happen to each and every one of you.
