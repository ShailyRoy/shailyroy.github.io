Then I worked on my SOP and LORs. Took help from seniors, friends and my teachers. Then shortlisted universities to apply according to my profile.

For apartment searching, if you don&rsquo;t know anyone who can manage an apartment for you, search in apartment.com app. The app version may not be available in Bangladesh, but the web version is accessible. Also there are some facebook groups for university students. search for that and then take decisions.</p><p>Buy refundable air tickets if your visa date is near your arriving date in usa. The earlier you buy a ticket, the less price you will get. Don&rsquo;t forget to take qatar student facilities while buying tickets.
We had only 2.30hour transition time in between two flights and I missed the next one for finding out luggages lately. So try to take more transition time . at least 4 hours to avoid these hassles. In airport you may need 5 to 6$ to carry bags , so make sure you bring change like
5$, 1$, 10$ with you.</p><p>Try to connect with the people as much as possible to get proper information of housing and everything. There should be facebook groups for bangladesh community of every university.</p><p>In USA, the medical cost of eyes and dentals are not covered in normal insurance. So the pricing is insanely high. Make sure you see dentists and eye specialists in BD before leaving.</p><h3 id=shopping-list>Shopping List</h3><p>You will find everything in USA, but initially it hurts to spend so much money to buy things. People try to bring everything but the weight limit gets existed in the blink of an eye. :'( so you can&rsquo;t&mldr;..</p><p>Here is the shopping list that people must buy before coming here.

The thing is never loose hope. You try your level best. The rest of the things will be your luck. The journey is never smooth. I got a visa interview date after trying day and night for almost 2 months. Before that, getting admission was matter of eligibility, capability but in case of visa date, it was all about luck which was the most stressful one so far.</p><p>By the way, <b>don&rsquo;t forget to contact the coordinators to waive your application fee</b>.</p><p>However, the next top USA group is a treasure for every applicant. I am thankful to this group and every single person who supported me throughout this journey.</p><p>Best of luck to all the applicants. I pray and hope that the best things happen to each and every one of you.</p></div><hr><div class="row next-prev-navigator"></div><hr></div></div></div><a id=scroll-to-top class=btn><i class="fas fa-chevron-circle-up"></i></a></section><section class=toc-section id=toc-section><div class=toc-holder><h5 class="text-center pl-3">Table of Contents</h5><hr><div class=toc><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#my-experience>My experience</a></li><li><a href=#my-profile-when-i-applied>My Profile when I applied</a></li><li><a href=#universities-i-applied>Universities I Applied</a></li><li><a href=#visa-interview-experience>Visa Interview Experience</a><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#conversation-between-me-and-vo>Conversation Between Me and VO</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=#after-obtaining-visa-date>After obtaining Visa Date</a></li><li><a href=#shopping-list>Shopping List</a><ul><li><a href=#bags>Bags</a></li><li><a href=#outfits>Outfits</a></li><li><a href=#electronics>Electronics:</a></li><li><a href=#food>Food:</a></li><li><a href=#styling>Styling:</a></li><li><a href=#medicines>Medicines:</a></li><li><a href=#others>Others:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#few-words>Few words</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></div></section></div><footer class="container-fluid text-center align-content-center footer pb-2"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row text-left"><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Navigation</h5><ul><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#about>About</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#cv>Education</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#experiences>Experiences</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#research-projects>Research</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#involvements>Involvements</a></li><li class=nav-item><a class=smooth-scroll href=/#achievements>Achievements</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-md-4 col-sm-12"><h5>Contact me:</h5><ul><li><span>Official Email:</span> <span>shaily.roy@bracu.ac.bd</span></li><li><span>Personal Email:</span> <span>shailyroy37@gmail.com</span></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/popper.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/bootstrap.min.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/navbar.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/plyr.js></script><script type=text/javascript src=/js/main.js></script><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.18.1/highlight.min.js></script><script src=/js/single.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script></body></html>
