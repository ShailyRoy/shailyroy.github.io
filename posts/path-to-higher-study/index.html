I&rsquo;m certainly not an expert, and there are many individuals out there achieving much more in diverse fields! Many are thriving in amazing places! It&rsquo;s quite impressive! However, I&rsquo;m content with my average achievements. :p Still, some have inquired, so I thought of penning down a post! If it helps anyone, that&rsquo;s great!</p><p>Essentially, venturing beyond academics doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean pursuing a new job or a career goal! It might be a path where the destination is unclear, and perhaps, no one really knows where it leads! In my opinion, it&rsquo;s a journey where assistance is needed at every stage! There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty, so mental stability is crucial!</p><h3 id=greielts>GRE/IELTS</h3><p>I have started my journey from the ending of september 2021. I haven&rsquo;t taken the GRE, so I can&rsquo;t provide insights on that. Many universities in the USA have waived the GRE requirement due to the pandemic, and some have made it optional. If you can take the GRE, it&rsquo;s definitely a plus. However, a strong profile without GRE is also worth considering! Information related to GRE waivers can be found by searching in higher studies fb groups. As for IELTS, watching English movies extensively is beneficial. Practice from the website IELTS online tests and follow tutorials from Liz, youtubers. Personal efforts are essential, and online resources are abundant. I started my preparation in September, took the test in October. I was a full time lecturer , so managing time was challenging, practiced IELTS things outside of office hours, got a good amount of support from the family. I&rsquo;m not an avid English movie watcher, so I had to put in extra effort! What I gained from the process makes me happy!</p><h3 id=soplor>SOP/LOR</h3><p>For writing the SOP, it&rsquo;s crucial to read many SOPs. Afterward, craft your own! Some prefer writting the intial draft before reading others write ups. In my case, after reading, rewriting felt better! Searching for sample SOPs in groups like &ldquo;Next Top USA&rdquo; yields plenty of resources. SOPs should be updated according to each university&rsquo;s requirements, try to relate your research with the university faculties which helps for better chance. Regarding LOR, it&rsquo;s advisable to draft one yourself, and faculty members can make changes according to their perspective. You are the one who knows the best about your profile. Try to support your statements with proof like grades, papers, projects in the LOR. Writing three/four different formats for LORs is good practice. It helps if faculty members can recognize you, so recommendation requests should be made wisely. Having at least seven recommenders is a good strategy for multiple universities. Reminders from your side are essential, as faculty members are often busy. When communicating with recommenders, maintain a formal and respectful tone to convey professionalism and gratitude. To streamline the recommendation process, consider completing all your university applications before reaching out. Seek explicit permission from recommenders before including their names, ensuring they are aware of the commitment.</p><h3 id=cvresumewebsite>CV/Resume/Website</h3><p>It&rsquo;s essential to create a CV/Resume in LaTeX. A personal website on GitHub is also helpful, and using Google Analytics to track visits enhances your profile. When people from outside the country visit your website, it leaves a positive impression. The website acts as your portfolio! Emphasize your strong points in the CV, and detailed information about high school and secondary school isn&rsquo;t necessary. Minimal personal information, such as phone number and email address, is sufficient. Avoid unnecessary details like parents' names and birth dates. In the context of outside work or technology-related activities, having a publication is good, but if you don&rsquo;t have one, preprints using EasyChair for project papers are an option. Some universities are very interested in diversity, so mentioning extracurricular activities, especially for women in technology, is important. Contests, Olympiads, and similar achievements should be highlighted. Any work or gap years should be briefly mentioned. Not having any study gaps is also a plus!</p><p>For a website demo, here is mine: shailyroy.github.io</p><h3 id=university-selection>University Selection</h3><p>I have primarily relied on online websites to find universities that match my profile. I have applied to universities where people I know are studying. I love to be with people and I am an ambivert person , So tried to be in the safe side. It is always helpful to have some known people around you in abroad. But if you can&rsquo;t make it, don&rsquo;t worry. I also came in a complete new place where I knew none. Initially I struggled, tried to connect with new people via social media even before coming to make things comfortable for me , networking is really important to survive here and finally got a circle to hangout later. I have also applied to places where my relatives and friends are applying. I admit I have been somewhat casual about the process and haven&rsquo;t conducted intense research. I have often sought help from my friends and seniors when needed.</p><p>The application fee is really high when you apply to multiple universities. Be prepared for that. Sometimes I requested a fee waiver due to financial constraints from the co-ordinators and they approved. The application process has taken time, and I had to be very patient. The deadlines for most universities were around December 15th, but some accepted applications until March.</p><p>After submitting applications, I waited, and in late January, I started receiving emails for interviews. I emphasized the importance of researching professors and being well-prepared for interviews. Weather considerations for the location of the university were also important. If the interview went well, there was hope for a positive outcome.</p><p>Before applying, it was crucial to write a well-crafted email to professors expressing interest in joining their research. Although not all universities required it, many interviews were necessary. I personally received offers from two universities after interviews. Others were central.</p><p>Additionally, getting funding directly from professors could increase the chances of acceptance. But don&rsquo;t rely on the verbal promise. Celebrations followed when receiving I-20 offer letters, but the visa process was challenging.</p><p>Rejection chances were high (80%) once the universities started releasing results. Mental preparation was crucial to deal with potential disappointments. When multiple offers came in, selecting a university based on personal preference completed the process.</p><h3 id=my-profile-when-i-applied>My Profile when I applied</h3><ul><li>B.Sc. in CSE (BRAC University)<br>CGPA of highest distinction</li><li>MSc in CSE (BRAC University)<br>CGPA of highest distinction (completed the coursework, thesis pending)</li><li>GRE: didn&rsquo;t attend<br></li><li>IELTS: 7<br></li><li>Publications: 3 (Conference 2 as first author, 1 as second author)

For apartment searching, if you don&rsquo;t know anyone who can manage an apartment for you, search in apartment.com app. The app version may not be available in Bangladesh, but the web version is accessible. Also there are some facebook groups for university students. search for that and then take decisions.</p><p>Buy refundable air tickets if your visa date is near your arriving date in usa. The earlier you buy a ticket, the less price you will get. Don&rsquo;t forget to take qatar student facilities while buying tickets.
We had only 2.30hour transition time in between two flights and I missed the next one for finding out luggages lately. So try to take more transition time . at least 4 hours to avoid these hassles. In airport you may need 5 to 6$ to carry bags , so make sure you bring change like
5$, 1$, 10$ with you.</p><p>Try to connect with the people as much as possible to get proper information of housing and everything. There should be facebook groups for bangladesh community of every university.</p><p>In USA, the medical cost of eyes and dentals are not covered in normal insurance. So the pricing is insanely high. Make sure you see dentists and eye specialists in BD before leaving.</p><h3 id=shopping-list>Shopping List</h3><p>You will find everything in USA, but initially it hurts to spend so much money to buy things.

The thing is never loose hope. You try your level best. The rest of the things will be your luck. The journey is never smooth.

I pray and hope that the best things happen to each and every one of you.</p><h3 id=how-is-my-initial-days-in-usa>How is my initial days in USA?</h3><p>November, 2022
Arriving here all by myself was a daunting experience, especially considering the worst flight experiences. For the initial seven days, I found myself in a continuous state of tears, overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness in this unfamiliar environment. Opting for a single furnished studio, I embarked on this journey entirely alone, marking a rather disheartening beginning. However, as time progressed, I had the opportunity to connect with individuals who arrived around the same time as I did. Engaging with people I had previously interacted with on social media became a turning point. Despite knowing no one initially, I eventually forged connections with like-minded individuals, which played a crucial role in overcoming the initial phase of loneliness. Organizing gatherings, sharing delicious homemade meals, and receiving support from this newfound community significantly alleviated the early struggles. This shift from solitude to a supportive social circle proved instrumental in transforming those initial challenging days into a more positive and enriching experience.</p><p>Now, I genuinely enjoy being in the USA. The level of freedom and security I experience in this country is something I had never felt before. As a girl, the extra insecurities that I used to associate with being independent and safe were non-existent in my own country. Courage, like going alone to the bus station at 3 am, was something I never had before, but it feels effortless here! Despite the expenses, managing everything is quite easy. The worries I had about the long distance in the country were not true at all.
Regarding academics, the pressure of exams and assignments is present throughout the week. Despite the academic pressure, the teachers are incredibly supportive. They patiently respond to emails about minor issues, and although many assignments are challenging, most of them are always there to help. Each course has a separate teaching assistant, and they are also available for assistance.
I didn&rsquo;t start solo research immediately, my professor made sure I learn from my seniors first, and seniors have been instrumental in guiding me. The help may not be available later, so it&rsquo;s essential to learn as much as possible now.
Regarding household chores, I am not too bothered. I used to do everything when I was in Dhaka as well. I manage things my way, and if I get bored with cooking occasionally, I can always order food from outside.
Despite being expensive, there&rsquo;s always something to do if you have the will to explore. The surroundings are beautiful with waterfalls, mountains, lakes, and parks nearby, especially if you have a car.
Among all the positives, there is one issue that bothers me—the transportation system. You need a car to move and public transportation is the worst part of Syracuse.
However, I miss the people and food of my country! There is no alternative to that.
