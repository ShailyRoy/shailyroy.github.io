# a summary about you
summaryCompany1: 'I am a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU), beginning in Fall 2024 after transferring from Syracuse University. I hold the Fulton Fellowship and serve as a Graduate Research Associate at ASU. From Fall 2022 to 2024, I pursued my PhD studies in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Syracuse University, supported by the Syracuse University Fellowship.

Prior to my PhD, I completed a thesis-based master’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at BRAC University in 2023 with a perfect CGPA of 4.0, following my bachelor’s degree in the same department in 2018 with the highest distinction. I then worked as a Lecturer at BRAC University and later in the Department of Software Engineering at Daffodil International University. 

During my studies at BRAC University, I served as a tutor for CSE and Mathematics for over two years, actively participated in competitive programming with multiple national recognitions, and co-organized contests and workshops with the BRAC University Computer Club (BUCC). I also gained industry experience as a software engineer at a US-based company and taught hardware implementation of programming. My research contributions include presenting work at international conferences.'
