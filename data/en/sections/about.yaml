# a summary about you
summaryCompany1: 'Hello I am Shaily Roy, working as a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Brac University from May, 2019. I have completed my undergraduate in Dec, 2018 from the same department with highest Distinction. Previously I was appointed as a lecturer in the Department of Software Engineering in Daffodil International University.
I performed as a student tutor of CSE and Mathematics in Brac University for more than 2 years and also was a programming contestant with multiple national recognitions. I have arranged several intra university programming contests as well as programming workshops in Brac University along with other contestants and BUCC during my student life. Before graduation, I used to be an instructor in an institution where students were taught hardware implementation of programming.
Besides, I have experience of working as a software engineer in a USA based company. I am interested in research as well and have successfully presented my works in well-known international Conferences.
After joining Brac University, I have designed and introduced a totally new elective course "CSE419: Programming Languages" and also coordinated Algorithm course in the department of CSE.
</br>
In MSc, I completed my university courses with cgpa 4 and 100% scholarship from the same university for my excellent academic background. Because of my intense keenness towards research, I took 6 courses in data science such as neural network, symbolic machine learning, advanced artificial intelligence, natural language processing, decision support system. I did some projects like benchmarking ML algorithms for detecting diabetic retinopathy, Predicting covid19 severity level using ML and published papers. You can check my github profile (https://github.com/shailyroy) to get the codes. 
Currently, I am doing thesis on Machine learning and explainable AI.
