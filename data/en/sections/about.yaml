# a summary about you
summaryCompany1: 'I am currently a PhD student at Arizona State University (ASU) as of Fall 2024, having transferred from Syracuse University. I received the Fulton Fellowship and a position as a Graduate Research Associate at ASU, allowing me to continue my PhD studies. Since Fall 2022, I had been studying in the Department of Computer Information Science and Engineering at Syracuse University, where I was awarded the prestigious Syracuse University Fellowship in recognition of my achievements.

Before my PhD journey, I worked as a Lecturer at my Alma Mater, BRAC University, where I graduated with the highest distinction in December 2018.  In 2023, I earned my thesis-based masterâ€™s degree from the same department with a perfect CGPA of 4.0. Additionally, I was appointed as a Lecturer in the Department of Software Engineering at Daffodil International University. During my time as a student at BRAC University, I served as a tutor for CSE and Mathematics for over two years. I was also actively involved in competitive programming, earning multiple national recognitions. I co-organized several intra-university programming contests and workshops with other contestants and the BRAC University Computer Club (BUCC).

Before graduation, I also taught hardware implementation of programming and gained experience as a software engineer at a USA-based company. Furthermore, I successfully presented my research at a renowned international conference.'
