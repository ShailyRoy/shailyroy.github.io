    My research lies at the intersection of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Human Sensing. I design AI systems that are fair, ethical, and context-aware.

    **Key areas of interest**
    - Federated Learning and Algorithmic Fairness
    - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
    - Multimodal Human Sensing and Context-Aware Modeling
    - Signal and Physiological Data Processing
    - Natural Language Processing
    - Ethical and Human-Centered AI
